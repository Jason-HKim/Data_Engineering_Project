## Data Engineering Spotify Data

**Question / Need:**
---
What makes a song popular on Spotify?

How can we predict the popularity of a song on spotify based on a variety of features?


**Data**
---

The data will be from a [Kaggle dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/yamaerenay/spotify-dataset-19212020-160k-tracks) of just under 600,000 tracks.

The dataset may be expanded using the Spotify API for the 70 million tracks currently on Spotify.


**Tools**
---
I plan on utilizing Google Cloud, SQLite DB Browser, and possible API calls from the Spotify Web API.

Flask to present the final product.

**MVP**
---
Create a product that can pull data from Spotify data, that will be processed and queried for insights.
