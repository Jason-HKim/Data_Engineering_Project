## MVP: Spotify Artist & Tracks Data

I obtained a dataset of ~600,000 tracks and ~1.1m artists on Spotify.

My end product would ideally be a streamlist web app that allows visualization of top n artists (by popularity and followers) and top n tracks.

Furthermore, I would like to create a predictor for song popularity based on multiple features included in the tracks dataset, as well as a popularity/follower predictor for an artist based on genres, and other features obtained through feature engineering.


Here is an example of the top 50 genres of music associated with all artists with a popularity level of 70 and above (1,972 artists in Kaggle Dataset):
